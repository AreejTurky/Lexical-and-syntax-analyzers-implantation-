# Lexical-and-syntax-analyzers-implantation-
This project covers the compiler's lexical analyzer and syntax analyzer code implementation into two parts.

*First part*
implements a finite automata program from given regular expression supported with the code description for 
1-	converting a given regular expression to NFA using Thomson construction 
2-	NFA to DFA using subset construction 
3-	converting regular expression to DFA directly
beside test and output, and screenshots of GUI.

*Second part*
implement LL (1) parsing after modifying the grammar to add some operators then re-write it to be parsed by LL (1) parsing. 
finally, we test our code with correct and incorrect input string.
